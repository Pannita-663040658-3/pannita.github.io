                        Hello! My name is Pannita Pananun, and I’m a third-year Computer Engineering student at Khon Kaen University. I became interested in web development when I first learned HTML, and that experience inspired me to keep learning how websites and applications work behind the scenes. Even though learning Python and Java at university was challenging, it taught me to be patient and keep improving through practice and teamwork.

                        Recently, I’ve been working with Flutter to build web applications, which has been both exciting and full of new challenges. I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and creating something useful from what I’ve learned. My goal is to keep growing as a developer and turn my ideas into real projects that can make a difference.

                <h3>Learning Programing: Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                <p>January 15, 2025</p>
                <article>
                    <p>I first got into coding through HTML, which sparked my interest in web design and development. I practiced regularly in class and on my own, which inspired me to learn more about becoming a web developer. However, when I entered university and started learning Python, I realized how different and challenging it was compared to HTML. At first, I struggled to understand the syntax and concepts, but with the help of tutorials, classmates, and consistent practice, I managed to improve step by step.<br></p>
                    <p>Later, I moved on to Java, which was even more complex and at times frustrating to learn. Despite the challenges, I found it exciting to solve more advanced problems and kept pushing myself to understand the concepts. That mindset helped me approach each new language and technology with more patience and determination.</p>
                    <p>In my Advanced Computer Programming course, I worked on a project using Flutter to develop a web application. It was my first experience with Flutter, and I faced many difficulties, from understanding its limitations to finding good resources. Still, by working with my teammates and troubleshooting problems one by one, we successfully built a fully functional app. This experience taught me the value of persistence, teamwork, and learning from challenges along the way.</p>
