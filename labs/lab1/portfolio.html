                        Hello! My name is Pannita Pananun, and I'm a third year Computer Engineering student at Khon Kaen University. I have a passion for web development, artificial intelligence, and creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. Throughout my academic journey, I've been fascinated by how technology can improve people's lives and make complex tasks simpler.

                        I chose Computer Engineering because I love the combination of hardware and software development. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and eventually start my own tech company foucused on educational technology soulutions for rural communities in Thailand.

                <h3>Learning Programing: Challenges and Solutions</h3>
                <p>January 15, 2025</p>
                <article>
                    <p>Programing has been one of the most rewarding yet challenging aspects of my computer engineering studies. When I first started with Python in my freshman year, I struggled with concepts like loops, functions, and object-oriented programming. The syntax seemed overwhelming, and I often felt lost when trying to solve complex problems.<br></p>
                    <p>What helped me improve was consistent practice and breaking down problem into smaller, manageable pieces. I started solving simple programing challenges on platforms like HackerRank and gradually worked my way up to more complex algorithms, I also found that explaining my code to classmates help me understand concepts better.</p>
                    <p>Now, as I work with web technologies like JavaScript, I can see how the fundamental programing concepts I learned with Python apply across different languages. The key is to be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way</p>
